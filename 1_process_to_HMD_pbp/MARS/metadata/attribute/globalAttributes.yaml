  Hybrid Millidecade Band Sound Pressure Levels Computed at 1 Minute Resolution
  from Oceanic Passive Acoustic Monitoring Recordings
  at the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) Cabled Observatory
summary: >-
  To understand natural and anthropogenic sound in the ocean, and to compare
  underwater soundscapes globally, standard methods of analysis must be applied
  to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Methods that balance constrained
  volume and adequate resolution of acoustic spectra have recently been published
  (Martin et al., 2021a,b). A community effort supported by NOAA, BOEM, U.S. Navy,
  and ONR was initiated to apply these methods to PAM datasets from around the world.
  This record represents the hybrid millidecade band (HMB) spectra of sound levels
  derived from calibrated PAM data.

  Data analysis was performed using Python Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PyPAM) software,
  version {{PyPAM_version}},
  to produce hybrid millidecade band (HMB) spectra of sound levels from oceanic audio recordings.
  Processing followed the methods defined in Martin et al. (2021a,b), and results were validated
  by comparison with results processed using the MATLAB code provided as supplemental material
  in Martin et al. (2021b).
  Power spectral density (PSD) levels were computed from 1-minute segments of audio data.
  The icListen is a digital hydrophone in which there is no separation between the sensor element,
  filters, amplifier, and analog-to-digital converter.
  The internal amplifier gain is included in the reported sensitivity.
  The equivalent ADC voltage range of this digital hydrophone is 6 Vppk, and because digital
  counts are mapped to [-1 1] by default in the reading software rather than the correct [-3 3],
  wav data as read were rescaled by multiplying by a factor of 3.
  Frequency-dependent sensitivity data were provided by Ocean Sonics as (dB re V/µPa)
  to allow for comparison with traditional analog hydrophones, thus PSD was computed from voltage data.
  By applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) with length equal to the sample rate,
  using Hann window and 50% overlap, PSD estimates (V^2/Hz) were computed with a frequency
  resolution of 1 Hz and a temporal resolution of 1 second.
  The 119 PSD estimates from each 1-minute segment were averaged, and the average spectrum
  for each minute was further processed to an HMB spectrum following Martin et al. (2021b).
  Each 1-minute spectrum (dB re V^2/Hz) was calibrated using the frequency-dependent hydrophone
  sensitivity (dB re V/µPa) data provided by the hydrophone manufacturer to obtain calibrated
  PSD (dB re 1 µPa^2/Hz).

  The hydrophone is housed at the top of a tripod, 1 m above the seafloor.
  Known anthropogenic noise sources include a power supply on the main observatory
  node (continuous at 50 and 100 kHz), a scientific echosounder on the MARS observatory
  that has been operational during portions of the time-series (energy centered at 38 kHz),
  and vehicles that operate near MARS for maintenance and research purposes
  (ship, remotely operated vehicle, and autonomous surface and profiling vehicles
  that use acoustic sensors and communication).
