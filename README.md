# SoundCoop
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks developed by the passive acoustic community for the SoundCoop project.

The SoundCoop Project was a three-year effort funded by NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System, Bureau for Ocean Energy Management, U.S Navy Living Marine Resources, and the Office of Naval Research. The goal of the project was to develop technology in collaboration with the PAM community to enable scalable processing of comparable sound level metrics and to provide open access to centralized data for science and management applications. 

U.S. and international scientists contributed PAM data spanning 12 separate long-term monitoring projects. Datasets from ten of these projects were used to calculate a specific sound level metric called the hybrid millidecade spectra across a diversity of labs and instruments.

The collaborative effort of the SoundCoop led to several advances in data management, processing, dissemination, visualization, and knowledge sharing. 
* Two open access software toolkits were produced by project members to process SoundCoop datasets into hybrid millidecade sound levels.
* SoundCoop Project members, along with the NCEI passive acoustic data archive team, established a standards-driven netCDF format, which greatly facilitated comparison and distribution of the hybrid millidecade sound levels.
* The project developers at Axiom Data Science built an interactive data portal (https://soundcoop.portal.axds.co/#) to visualize and explore the SoundCoop datasets alongside environmental data to show the benefits of connecting acoustic and non-acoustic information.
